## Overview
The project includes:
- A custom Transformer model implemented in PyTorch.
- Training and evaluation scripts.
- Preprocessing and tokenization using spaCy.
- Pre-trained GloVe embeddings for word representations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Transformer-Sentiment-Analysis.git
   cd Transformer-Sentiment-Analysis
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
